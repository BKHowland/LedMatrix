Program for my LED Matrix project. Loaded on ESP32.

Project details:
Takes audio input and splits the frequencies and corresponding amplitudes into distinct bands, which are then displayed on the physical matrix structure. 
Designed, 3d printed, wired, soldered, and programmed a matrix of individually addressable LEDs. 
Programmed in C++ with the FastLED library on an ESP32 microcontroller..
